# Task 7 - Creating Views 

# Objective
To learn how to simplify complex queries and secure data access using SQL views.



# Key Concepts
- **Views**: Virtual tables created using complex SELECT queries
- **Data Abstraction**: Hide underlying table structure
- **Security**: Expose only necessary data



# Views Created

1. `customer_order_summary` – Customer-level order and spending summary
2. `product_sales_summary` – Products with total quantity sold
3. `high_value_customers` – Customers who spent more than ₹10,000
4. `payments_by_method` – Total payments grouped by payment method
5. `order_payment_details` – Orders joined with payment data



# Usage Examples
- Selecting from views as if they were tables
- Filtering views (`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`) for reporting

 Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- Schema: `ecommerce_db`


# Files Included
- `task7_views.sql`: Contains view definitions and usage queries
